## What I found interesting
The article discussed that solutions that works for large companies such as Google and Microsoft are not necessarily suitable for small businesses. It's important to think about what you really need before picking your technology. The writer uses funny examples to show how software engineers sometimes get too excited about new technologies and end up choosing something because it's popular, not because it's the best choice for them. The article introduces a simple checklist called UNPHAT to help make better decisions. This checklist reminds us to first understand the problem, look at different options, read up on them, think about their history, compare the good and bad points, and really think about if it's the right fit.
